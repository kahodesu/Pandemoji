Pandemoji
=========

Prototype of game made with Chloe Varelidi for White House Game Jam 2014 - Sept 6-8 - for Education and Technology. 

Pandemoji is a silly classroom game which uses a webcam and face recognition software to provide a playful opportunity to talk about people's emotions, as a part of Social Emotional Learning. The player stands in front of the webcam, and on the screen or the projected image, can see Pandemojis falling from above, and catches one to wear on his or her face. The child is then given the opportunity to create a pose that expresses the chosen Pandemoji. After a countdown the game takes a screenshot and posts it into an archive. The image is then available for the teacher to use to further discuss emotions and expressions. This interactive experience is intended to not be a stand alone game but rather a part of a larger classroom discussion. 

The Processing sketch is made from many examples provided including: 
- the LiveCamTest Example in the OpenCV library for Processing
- the ArrayList example (http://processing.org/reference/ArrayList.html) with Ball Object Class example
- the TriggerAsSample and PlayAFile exaples in the Minim Library

Some things to work out: 
1. how face detection works in environments with certain lightning conditions (we had some problems in areas where the sunlight was really bright from the side)
2. placement of archived images
3. scale of stage of app (might look pretty small on a retina screen for example)
